**Orginal Assignment:** Build a web app that shows the local weather. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style. Fulfill the below user stories:

- as a user, I can see the weather in my current location
- as a user, I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather
- as a user, I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit & Celsius
